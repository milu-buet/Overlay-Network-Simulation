#How it works
1. On the left panel there is "Real Network". You can create a real network with any number of nodes.
2. On the right panel you can get a Overlay for the Real Network. The input is number of super-peer. I selected the super peers and their associated nodes randomly.
3. After getting Overlay you can see the routing between two nodes. Input is the "node_id" of source and destination.
